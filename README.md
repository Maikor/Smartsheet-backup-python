Smartsheet data Backup with attachments
===


Overview
--------
This script allow you to download tables and attachments, which you want to backup. 


Requirements
------------
* API access token generated by a Smartsheet account administrator (SysAdmin).  Please see this help article [http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/520100-user-types](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/520100-user-types) to learn about Smartsheet user types, and [http://www.smartsheet.com/developers/api-faq](http://www.smartsheet.com/developers/api-faq) for instructions on how to generate an API access token.


How it works
--------
* The backup utility will create a new folder with a timestamp in the user defined directory. This folder is used as the base folder for the backup process.
* Each sheet is saved as an XLS file that matches the Sheet's name, with discussions saved on a second tab inside the XLS file.  All file attachments are saved in a directory named "[Sheet Name]".  


Usage
------------

First step is to configure 3 variables in script.

1. `token = " Bearer TOKEN_NUMBER"`  Replace TOKEN_NUMBER with your real token (To receive token check link in requirements)

2. `dir = "backup/"` - specify directory in which you want to store backups

3. Fill dict `backed_up_sheets` with actual sheet name and it's ID.

That's all. After type: `python backup.py`  to run the script.
